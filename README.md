# Credit Card Fraud Risk Analysis Framework

A comprehensive analysis of credit card fraud patterns using Bayesian statistical methods to identify geographic and merchant risk concentrations.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: 100,000+ credit card transactions (October 2023 - October 2024)
- **Methodology**: Bayesian risk modeling with geographic and temporal analysis
- **Key Finding**: Framework successfully identified risk patterns across multiple dimensions

## Technical Approach
- Data processing and quality assessment (85.3% geographic mapping success)
- Bayesian fraud rate calculation to account for statistical uncertainty
- Geographic hotspot analysis identifying NY as highest-risk state
- Merchant risk stratification revealing 3-4x risk variations
- Temporal pattern detection showing seasonal fraud cycles

## Business Impact
Developed transferable analytical framework for ongoing fraud risk assessment that adapts to current data rather than relying on static assumptions.
